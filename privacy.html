    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

    <p>
      TILT ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in connection with the TILT mobile application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
      We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information such as:

      <li>Names</li>
      <li>Email addresses</li>
      <li>Phone numbers</li>
      <li>Physical addresses</li>
      <li>Payment information</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Gameplay Data</h3>
    <p>
      The App may store gameplay data locally on your device, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Game scores and achievements</li>
      <li>Game progress and settings</li>
      <li>User preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties. If the App includes leaderboard functionality, scores may be stored anonymously without any personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Device Information</h3>
    <p>
      We do not collect device information such as device type, operating system, or unique device identifiers.
    </p>

    <h3>1.4 Location Data</h3>
    <p>
      We do not collect, access, or track your location data.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use your data for any purpose other than providing the core gameplay experience. Any data stored locally on your device is used solely to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Save your game progress</li>
      <li>Remember your preferences and settings</li>
      <li>Display your scores and achievements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any information to third parties. Since no personal data is collected, there is nothing to share.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      TILT does not integrate with or use any third-party services, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics)</li>
      <li>Advertising networks</li>
      <li>Social media platforms</li>
      <li>Tracking or monitoring services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since all gameplay data is stored locally on your device, the security of this data depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a secure device lock (PIN, password, or biometric)</li>
      <li>Keeping your device's operating system up to date</li>
      <li>Being cautious about granting app permissions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      TILT is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of consent in your jurisdiction). Since the App does not collect any personal data, it complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us immediately at <strong>tilt.app.contact@gmail.com</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      All data is stored locally on your device. You can delete all App data at any time by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uninstalling the App from your device</li>
      <li>Clearing the App's data through your device settings</li>
      <li>Using any in-app data deletion features (if available)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect personal information, traditional data privacy rights (such as access, correction, or deletion requests) do not apply. However, you maintain full control over any locally stored data on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>9. International Users</h2>
    <p>
      TILT is available worldwide. Since no data is transmitted or stored on our servers, there are no international data transfer concerns.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes, we will:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy</li>
      <li>Post the updated policy on this page</li>
      <li>Notify users through the App if changes are material</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
